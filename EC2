When we stop EC2 instance and start it again then Public IPv4 address will change but private IPv4 will not change.

While creating a key pair value for logging into instance use .ppk if you are using windows 7 or earlier version of windows etc else use .pem.

While creating an instance you can choose the number of CPUs, memory (hardware or EBS) , bandwidth, Operating System etc as per requiremnt and set your instance privately and you dont need to own any hardware etc to setup an instance.

There are 7 different types of EC2 instances and each type of instance has different families.

More the size of instance, more the CPU , more the memory you will have for EC2.

General Purpose EC2 Instance - ideal for applications that use compute, memory and networing resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.

Compute Optimized EC2 Instance - great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors. Ideal for compute bound applications that benefir from high performance processors.

Memory Optimized EC2 Instances - fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

Storage Optimized EC2 Instances - great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large sets on local storage.

If we need to provide AWS credentials to EC2 instance, we provide these credentials through IAM Role. We go on action > Security > Modify IAM Role, then we choose our IAM Role,
and save and hence our IAM role would be attached to EC2 instance.
