IAM - Identity and Access Management (Global Service)
We create users and assign them to a group.

Why do we create users and why do we create groups : because we want to allow them to use our AWS accounts and to allow them to do so we need to give them permissions.

Users and Groups are assigned json documents called polices

Inline policies - policy which is only attached to a user, so that a user could or could not belong to a group, we can have inline policies for whatever user you want.


AWS infrastructure is the responsibility of AWS shared responsibility model.
