Load Balancer has health checks performed on EC2 instance in order to ensure that whether the traffic can be sent to a particular EC2 instance or not. For user, Load balancer
acts as one end point of connectivity only.Then load balancer spreads load from users to multiple downstream EC2 instances.

Health check is done on a port and route.

Load Balancer allows traffic from Users from anywhere that source of Security group of load balancer is set to IP - 0.0.0.0/0

And the source of security group of EC2 instance is set to sg of load balancer so that EC2 instance only allows traffic if the traffic originates from Load Balancer,
which is enhanced security mechanism.

If you find that your application can only be accessed within one, two or three different IPs, then you need to think about Network load balancer as an option.

Network Load Balancer has a one fixed IP address per availability zone where we are deploying Load balancer.

Target group contains group of EC2 instances whom load balancer want to use or target for distributing traffic.
