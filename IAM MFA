To protect users and groups from being compromised for this we have 2 defence mechanism.

1) IAM password policy
2) Multi factor Authentication - to protect your root account and the IAM users

Multi factor authentication - password you know and the security device you own (like the phone we use to login)

Authy - support for multiple token on a single device.

When we enable MFA we can access our AWS account only at one device at a time.
