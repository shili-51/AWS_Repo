Suppose we create an EC2 instance (virtual server). This EC2 instance may want to perform some actions on AWS. and 
to do so we need to give permissions to our EC2 instance. To do so we are going to create 
IAM role and together IAM role and EC2 instance will make one entity.
So if an EC2 instance is trying to gather some information from AWS account then it will use the IAM Role.
And if the permission assigned to the IAM role is correct, then we are going to get the access for the call we are trying to make.

Role allow entities in the AWS to get credentials for short duration and do whatever they need to do.
