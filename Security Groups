Security Groups are firewalls and they decide from which port inbound traffic is allowed or denied.

One security group cane be attached to multiple instances.
Also one instance can have multiple security groups.

If you switch from one region to other or we create a new VPC then we have to make recreate new security groups.

Security groups lives outside the EC2 instance - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.
