Users can use AWS. There are 3 ways:

AWS Management Console - protected by Username or password or may be MFA

AWS Command line interface - protected by access keys(credentials we can download) that would allow us to use AWS through the terminal.

AWS SDk - this is used whenever we want to call API from AWS within your application code and these will be protected by access keys.

Dont share access key and secret access key with anyone.

When access key and secret access key are loaded in command line interface would allow me to access the AWS API.


AWS SDK - 
 boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.
 AWS CLI is build on AWS SDK for python.
 
 
 Never use root account to create security credentials.
